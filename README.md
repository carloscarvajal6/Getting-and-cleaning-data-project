# Getting-and-cleaning-data-project

This is the repository for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project, by Jeff Leek, Roger D. Peng, and Brian Caffo, from the Johns Hopkins University, via Coursera.

Here are the data for the project: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

CodeBook.md is the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

## Task

I should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Scripts and their connections

run_analysis.R is the R script that does what is required in the task (cf. previous point)
